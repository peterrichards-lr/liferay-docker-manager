# LDM Project Mandates

This file establishes the foundational mandates for Liferay Docker Manager development.

## 1. Hybrid Volume Strategy (macOS / ExFAT)

To resolve critical filesystem locking deadlocks (e.g., `Unable to create lock manager` or `access_denied_exception`), LDM MUST use a split-volume approach:

- **Named Docker Volumes**: MUST be used for directories requiring POSIX file locking.
  - `/opt/liferay/data`
  - `/opt/liferay/osgi/state`
- **Host Bind-Mounts**: SHOULD be used for directories facilitating developer hot-reloads.
  - `/mnt/liferay/deploy`
  - `/mnt/liferay/files`
  - `/mnt/liferay/scripts`
  - `/opt/liferay/osgi/modules`
  - `/opt/liferay/osgi/client-extensions`
  - `/opt/liferay/osgi/log4j`
- **macOS Hypervisor Sync**: LDM MUST implement a minimum 2-second "Sync Wait" after extracting backups to the host and before hydrating Docker volumes. This compensates for VirtioFS/gRPC-FUSE sync lag, ensuring files created on the Mac are physically visible to the Linux VM.

## 2. Infrastructure Enforcement

- **Database**: Standardize on PostgreSQL with mandatory healthchecks.
- **Search**: Use shared Global Search (ES8) by default; support Sidecar fallback isolation.
- **Self-Tuning JVM**: LDM MUST proactively scale JVM resources (e.g. `ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m`) and disable restrictive optimizations (e.g. `TieredStopAtLevel=1`) during "Production-grade" workloads like full search reindexing to prevent `NoSuchMethodException` and `CodeCache` exhaustion.
- **Logging**: Force `LIFERAY_LOG4J2_CONFIGURATION_FILE` injection to guarantee hot-reload capability.

## 3. Automation Standards

To support CI/CD pipelines and headless automation, all LDM commands MUST adhere to a standardized exit code contract:

- `0`: **Success**.
- `1`: **Generic/Validation Error**.
- `2`: **Authentication/Permission Error** (e.g. LCP login required).
- `3`: **Infrastructure/Data Error** (e.g. Backup download failure).
- `4`: **Orchestration/Deployment Error**.
- `126`: **Command Invocation Error**.

## 4. Pre-Release Strategy

To prevent "version fatigue" and ensure the stability of the main release channel:

- **Experimental Features**: All brand new or complex functionality (specifically **Liferay Cloud Golden Path** integrations) MUST be released as **Pre-Releases** (e.g. `v2.10.x-pre.y`) first.
- **Verification Gate**: A pre-release feature is only eligible for a stable release after the user has performed a full E2E verification and confirmed its success.
- **Stable Promotion**: Stable releases (`[release]`) MUST be reserved for hardened features and verified bugfixes.

## 5. Liferay Cloud Golden Path

LDM serves as a bridge for Liferay Cloud development. To maintain stability, it enforces a strict boundary:

- **Code (Git)**: Git remains the source of truth for the workspace structure, Client Extensions, and OSGi source. LDM must NEVER modify the user's Git history or structure.
- **Data (LCP)**: LDM automates the retrieval and restoration of Cloud backups (`database.gz` and `volume.tgz`).
- **Orchestration**: LDM must dynamically flatten LCP's nested backup structures into standard LDM snapshots during hydration.
